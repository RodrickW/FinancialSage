Step 4:
Token revocation
If the client chooses to revoke generated access and refresh tokens, it can be done by calling the revoke token endpoint. To revoke a token, a client application would make a request to the revocation endpoint as shown in the below sample in the sandbox environment:

curl -X POST https://sandbox-us-api.experian.com/oauth2/v1/revokeToken \
  -H 'client_id: GfiivuSKYI8oU5X6QQmAdGrXlNGkp8Ex' \
  -H 'client_secret: XM2qQ4XapHjPEbZ6' \
  -H 'token: eyJraWQiOiJBSmpTMXJQQjdJODBHWjgybmNsSlZPQkF3V3B3ZTVYblNKZUdSZH' \
